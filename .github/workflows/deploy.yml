# NOTE: This workflow is being replaced by deploy-production.yml
# The new deployment workflow includes:
# - CI checks as prerequisite
# - GitHub release creation
# - Better deployment steps
# - Health checks
#
# This workflow is kept for backward compatibility.
# Consider migrating to deploy-production.yml for new features.
